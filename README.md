# CSVDomWdeg

I got the python files from here: https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/tree/master.

I modified csp.py to implement the dom/wdeg variable ordering.

Dom/wdeg is described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00909.

I only needed to modify csp.py.

I also created exams.py, which simulates a simple CSP for the creation of the exams program
for my faculty. The program solves the problem with various combinations of Constraint Propagation
and Variable Ordering.
